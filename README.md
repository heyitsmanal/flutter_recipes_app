## 🔐 Service configuration
Cloudinary values are supplied at build/run time instead of being committed in source:

```bash
flutter run \\
  --dart-define=CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name \\
  --dart-define=CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your-upload-preset
```

Firebase client configuration is part of the mobile client, so access must be protected with restrictive Firebase Security Rules and appropriate API restrictions in the Firebase/Google Cloud console. The Cloudinary unsigned upload preset should also be restricted to the transformations, formats, and limits the app actually needs.
